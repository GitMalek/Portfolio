    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! If you're reading this from the applicant discord, the website isn't exactly complete.<br><br>
    As you can see, I haven't written the About Me yet. 'Other Skills' also doesn't work.
    
    <br><br>
    Despite that, the meat
    is in the 'Design Projects' tab, there you'll find one listed project- but I've done a large series of case studies
    on my design decisions for it. The only thing incomplete text-wise in it is the UX Design page, which is meant to be
    a video tour of my cooking menu, it's not feature complete yet is all. Still, I attached a video of the current look, and
    the script for the intended final product!

    <br><br>
    Sorry, but I haven't added art yet. If the pages look sparse or tiring, keep in mind that I'll be adding some screenshots
    of the game, as well as character sprites and chibi art across them when they're relevant. When a page is slanted to one
    direction like this, it's usually because the other side will have some splash-art or pop-up notes.
    <br><br>

    I would generally appreciate any and all advice you can give me! Though I wouldn't blame you for skimming. I'm mostly curious
    about the length of the content. I'll be participating in a game jam in december, so I'll likely add what I'll make for that 
    as a shorter project entry here. Is it already too long? Is the current project strong enough to carry the portfolio? I'd be
    happy for any and all feedback! If you're curious how the game looks in its current state, this is the look as of now. It'll
    hopefully be less empty come submission time!
